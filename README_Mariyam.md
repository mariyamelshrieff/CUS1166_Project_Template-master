## Use cases 

* RUN APP USING `python -m flask run`
- I started by sketching a low-fidelity wire frame on how will the use case looks like in terms of interface then I created around four attributes to identify appointments `Appointment_title`, `appointment_customer_name` , `appointment_desc`, `appointment_customer_name`, `appointment_location`, `appointment_date` 
and create the appointments table. 

- The view of the app is from the technicions perspective a well as the customer.

- My code is integrated with the sample code
